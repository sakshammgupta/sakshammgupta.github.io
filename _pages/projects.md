* **Intelligent (Environment Aware) Autonomous Vehicle**,
  * for IGVC (Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition), organized by RoboNation
  * Aug 2019 – Jun 2020
     Annual international competition held at Rochester Institute of Technology where multiple teams of multi-disciplinary nature compete to build an autonomous              vehicle according to a fixed set of rules to compete on various grounds.
       * **Led a team of 20+ students**; oversaw all major aspects of the product's (robot's) development from manufacturing to electronics to
computer programming.
       * Developed a fully compliant all-terrain vehicle for autonomous motion tracking; path planning & traversal.

* **An open, easily replicable & modular design for a regenerative aqua pump,**
  * Final Year Undergraduate Project
  * Jul 2019 – Apr 2020
An innovative project to design and build non-electric treadle like water pumps that instead of using electricity, generates battery power
thus tackling the vexed water-energy-nexus challenge. Donated it to a rural municipal corporation in India.
    * Designed an open-hardware system using commercial off the shelf components (COTS); which can be easily replicated at scale.
    * Developed a modular water pump - can be connected to any bicycle & used for generating electricity & for pumping water at the same
time from a well.
    * Achieved a low cost - high ROI (with one-time CAPEX) by designing a product with eco-friendly; readily-available & economic
components.

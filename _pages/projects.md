* **Intelligent (Environment Aware) Autonomous Vehicle**,
  * for IGVC (Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition), organized by RoboNation
  * Aug 2019 – Jun 2020
     *Annual international competition held at Rochester Institute of Technology where multiple teams of multi-disciplinary nature compete to build an autonomous              vehicle according to a fixed set of rules to compete on various grounds.
       * **Led a team of 20+ students**; oversaw all major aspects of the product's (robot's) development from manufacturing to electronics to
computer programming.
       * Developed a fully compliant all-terrain vehicle for autonomous motion tracking; path planning & traversal.

* **An open, easily replicable & modular design for a regenerative aqua pump,**
  * Final Year Undergraduate Project
  * Jul 2019 – Apr 2020
    * An innovative project to design and build non-electric treadle like water pumps that instead of using electricity, generates battery power
thus tackling the vexed water-energy-nexus challenge. Donated it to a rural municipal corporation in India.
      * Designed an open-hardware system using commercial off the shelf components (COTS); which can be easily replicated at scale.
      * Developed a modular water pump - can be connected to any bicycle & used for generating electricity & for pumping water at the same
time from a well.
      * Achieved a low cost - high ROI (with one-time CAPEX) by designing a product with eco-friendly; readily-available & economic
components.

* **NMIMS Robotics Testbed - 1 (NRT-1), a satellite payload,** 
  * Manufacturing Engineer 
  * Oct 2019 – Feb 2020
    *  A pilot project to study the behaviour of Magnetic Shape Memory Alloy in space.
      * Oranganized by ISRO (the Indian Space Research Organization); under its SpaceShare program - about 8-9 applications were finalized
from a pool of thousands of research proposals (which included top Indian Institutes).
      *  Designed and manufactured a test-bed for a Terfenol-D (magnetostrictive material) in space. The project deliverable is a payload; set to
launch on an upcoming PSLV rocket (in Q3 2022).
      *  Lead design & manufacturing of a highly constrained payload (constrained by space, dimensions, weight & scale of components
attached).
      *  Performed various regression & stress tests on the payload - thermovac, vibrations, signal encryption & attenuation in Class 1 clean
rooms.

* **Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge 2018 & 2019,**
  * Jun 2017 – Jul 2019
    * Annual Robotics Challenge organized by the IEEE OES (Oceanic Engineering Society).
      * Led a team of 12 students; for designing, manufacturing & building an underwater autonomous vehicle.
      * The team won numerous accolades - stood 4th amongst 45 international teams in 2018; stood 7th amongst 57 international teams in
2019; bagged the Social Media Prize in 2019.
      * Designed a modular, component-based AUV system for performing a multitude of tasks - SLAM based navigation & planning; visual
identification of key zones/areas in the robot vicinity; acoustics (hydrophones, DVL) based localization & performing various
decommissioning tasks with the help of a 6-DOF robotic arm.

* **Student race car with a carbon fiber chassis, Formula Bharat (India) 2017** 
  * Aug 2016 – Jul 2017
    * National student racing competition (F1-style) where hundreds of national-level teams participate to compete over various grounds.
      * The first foray into building intelligent vehicles (products) - developed an understanding of all technical aspects such as racing car
vehicle dynamics, aerodynamics, impact attenuation, fatigue testing, designing parts at micro-scale & integrating at the macro
(systems engineering), design of exhausts, steering, suspensions, etc.

* **Soft Robotic Pneumatic Arm,**
  * for Undergraduate Course - Electro Mechanical Workshop Project
    * Designed & manufactured a soft robotics gripper that can grab protean shapes.
    * Arm was based on a simple bio-mimetic principle - three tentacle based gripping.

MS Student, looking forward to make my mark in the world. Robotics enthusiast, love building things on a daily basis.

Since our lives are changing in unimaginable ways post-pandemic; I'd wager Robotics to play a much larger role in our day-to-day lives a couple of years down. Working on multiple projects to achieve this vision - get in touch with me if you have something excited to discuss [(or if you just want to connect!)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sakshammgupta/)
